        <p>Welcome to an online webapp version of Monikers, a dumb party game that respects you intelligence.</p>
        <b>Rules:</b>
        <br>
        
        <p>A person from the starting team has 60 seconds to get their team to guess as many names as possible from the deck by giving clues about the card's identity. Thereâ€™s no limit to the number of guesses.</p>

        <p>Skipping is allowed and highly encouraged in all rounds.</p>
        
        <p>Teams keep the cards they guessed correctly for scoring. Skipped cards are reshuffled into the deck after each turn.</p>
        
        <p>Teams take turns giving clues. Each player should take a turn giving clues before any teammates repeat.</p>
        
        <p>A round ends when all cards from the deck have been guessed correctly. When that happens, teams add the point values from each card they correctly guessed.</p>
        
        <p>The team with the lowest score begins the next round.</p>
